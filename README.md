# Busy Beaver
Simplest 2-state Turing machine in Go to experiment on the [busy beaver problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver).

It is as an appendix for a small [article](article.pdf) (in french) that I wrote as part of an assignment for my university.

To try it, just install go and run:
```
go build
./busy-beaver
```
